                        You may use our Services by attending sending or receiving money or Pay for an invoice sent by merchant registered on our platform through your PS wallet or attached Credit card, Debit card or Bank accounts. 

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        We call information collected for these services ‘Customer Collected Information.’

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Merchants who use our Pay Invoice System upload or support the uploading of information about their Customers, members and other individuals. In this case, the Merchant Administrator determines what personal information they will collect from you.  That information is usually not disclosed to us nor do we have any right to use that information.

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        We process Customer Collected Information as a Data Processor (for GDPR purposes).

                        <br>

                        <br>

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        PS does not knowingly collect any Personal Information from or about a child (which we generally regard as anyone under the age of 16 years, subject to local law requirements) without the consent of the child’s parent or legal guardian. We may ask for evidence of a user’s date of birth to help us verify this.

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        If we discover that we have inadvertently collected information from a child without the appropriate consent, we will promptly take all reasonable measures to delete that data from our systems. 

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        <strong>8. How we collect your personal information.</strong>

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        We collect Customer Information and Individual Information directly through forms on the Website, Mobile App or when a Merchant Administrator or other individual signs up for a Service or establishes an Account directly with us.

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        We may also collect information:

                            <li>

                            </li>
                            <li>

                        <br>

                        Customer Collected Information is collected by the Merchant you are connected to, including when you interact with one of the PS Services. In most cases, PS does not directly collect or control any Customer Collected Information.

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        If you are concerned about the Customer Collected Information that has been included in any of PS’s Services, we recommend you contact the Merchant you are affiliated with.

                        PS may disclose or transfer personal information to a third party in the event of a proposed or actual purchase, sale, lease, merger, amalgamation or any other type of acquisition, disposal, transfer, conveyance or financing of all or any portion of Express Ca Corp in order for you to continue to receive the same services from the third party.

                        <br>
                        we ensure that they will comply with all the obligations contained in this Policy either as part of the terms of service we have with them or pursuant to their commitment as Merchants that have certified as being compliant with the EU-US Privacy Shield arrangement.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        We give our Customers the option to use services that may involve third parties. This may be done via a link to another service or website and may include, as an example, links to PayPal or Stripe for online payment as part of our service.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The decision to use these services is at the discretion of each Customer.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Although we try to only partner with reputable and trustworthy suppliers, we cannot control or be responsible for the policies of other sites we may link to, or the use of any personal information you may share with them. Please note that this Policy does not cover these other websites, and we recommend that you review the privacy policies attached to the use of those services and websites before deciding whether to proceed.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        If you opt to use an optional third-party processor, you give that processor the right, power, and authority to act on your behalf to access and transmit your personal and other information (including Financial Information) according to terms of that third-party provider’s privacy policy. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        If you do not want your Individual Information to be shared with third parties for example for the purposes of emailing or texting you or supporting any activity, please let the Merchant you are affiliated with know and they can disable these services for you.

                        <strong>10.3. Financial Information</strong>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        When undertaking a financial transaction via our Services, for example, when sending money, adding money to your wallet or withdrawing money from your wallet, you may provide information including credit, debit or bank account details, and your name and address (“Financial Information”).  PS does not disclose Financial Information except to the appropriate banking institutions or payment processing provider in order to process a credit or debit authorization for payment, or to resolve a dispute or for other related purposes. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        PS does not have any access to your Financial Information inputted via third party payment processors.

                        <br>
                        We use social networking services such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube to communicate with Customers, Merchant Administrators, Authorized Users, Merchants and the public about our Services. When you communicate with us using these services, we may collect your personal information. The social networking service will also handle your personal information for its own purposes. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Our Site may also contain links to websites not affiliated with the PS.
                        <br>

                        These social networking and non-affiliated sites have their own privacy policies, and we recommend that you review them. We cannot control or be responsible for the policies of other sites we may link to, or the use of any personal information you may share with them.

                        <strong>11. International Transfers of Personal Information</strong>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Some of the processors and sub-processors we use are located in jurisdictions including Australia, the US, the United Kingdom and the EU. Use of their services may involve the cross-border transfer of personal information. PS also has offices and employees located globally, for example, in the USA and the United Kingdom. This means that the PS may process personal information in another country from time to time. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In all cases, appropriate safeguards for the purposes of the GDPR and other laws which restrict the cross-border flow of personal information, have been established and are maintained, whether in the form of standard contractual clauses, appropriate inter-company agreements, adequacy measures or through ensuring certification with the US-EU Privacy Shield.  For more information, please refer to our Terms of Service (and the PS Data Processing Addendum).

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Access to your account is secured via unique user passwords.  You can help to keep your personal information secure by ensuring that any password you use is kept strictly confidential and by logging off when you have finished using a shared computer.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        More information about your security responsibilities is included in the Terms of Service.

                        <strong>12.2. Data Security</strong>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        We take steps to protect the security of the personal information we hold from both internal and external threats by:
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li>regularly assessing the risk of misuse, interference, loss, and unauthorised access, modification or disclosure of that information</li>
                            <li>conducting regular internal and external audits to assess whether we have adequately complied with or implemented these measures.</li>
                            <li>encrypting the transfer of data all the way from the browser to where the data is stored. We use HTTPs and all our data is encrypted at rest.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>12.3. Data Breaches</strong>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Unfortunately, no data transmitted over or accessible through the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while PS attempts to protect all Personal Information, PS cannot ensure or warrant that Personal Information will be completely secure from misappropriation by hackers or from other nefarious or criminal activities, or in the event of a failure of computer hardware, software, or a telecommunications network. 

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        If a data breach (as defined by applicable laws) involving Personal Information occurs, PS will:
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li>notify you of it as soon as reasonably possible after it comes to our attention.</li>
                            <li>take reasonable steps to secure the affected data and minimise harm to all individuals; and</li>
                            <li>provide you with whatever reasonable assistance might otherwise be required.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Please note, our obligations in regard to notification of data breaches may vary depending on whether we are acting as Data Controller or Data Processor in regard to the Personal Information affected by the data breach.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>12.4. Retention of Personal Information</strong>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Generally, we will keep Personal Information for as long as a Customer is actively using PS’s Services or the period during which any legal claim may be made in regard to the provision of Services in accordance with legal requirements or to meet our legal obligations. For example, we hold billing records, and any information associated with those records for 7 years. 

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        If we hold personal information about you, and we do not need that information for any purpose, we will take reasonable steps to securely destroy or de-identify that information unless we are prevented from doing so by law.

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        We apply the following rules to the permanent deletion of information:

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Customer accounts and associated Individual Information, where there has been no activity for more than 6 months (and where not required for PS’s own records or administrative processes) will be deleted permanently; and

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Individual Information which has been deleted or disabled, will be permanently deleted or de-identified 90 days after deletion or disabling (or 18 months where members have financial data associated to them).

If an individual feels their Merchant has not dealt with their request promptly or effectively, we will work with the relevant data controller to attempt to resolve their request.
